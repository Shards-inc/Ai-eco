# The Sovereign AI Manifesto (2026)

## 1. Data Autonomy
Sovereign AI demands that intelligence is computed where the data lives. No data shall leave the perimeter of the enterprise for inference or training without explicit, cryptographic consent.

## 2. Model Pluralism
We reject the monopoly of closed API models. A sovereign stack is built on open-weights foundation models (LLaMA, DeepSeek, Qwen) that can be inspected, audited, and fine-tuned on-premise.

## 3. Agentic Accountability
As agents move from "assistants" to "executors," accountability is paramount. Every agent action must be logged, trace-audited, and revocable.

## 4. Compute Sovereignty
Ownership of hardware (GPUs) or dedicated, isolated cloud slices is the only defense against "model de-platforming" or sudden price surges in the agentic economy.
